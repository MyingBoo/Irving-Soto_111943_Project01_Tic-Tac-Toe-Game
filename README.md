I created a tic tac toe game that you can play with someone, obviously on the same computer and passing the mouse to get your turn. It's a simple game since everyone 
knows how to play a game of tic tac tou or x and 0 like we call them on Puerto Rico. This game consist on the graphics.py module, because that is what were working at the time.
This game it's in turns and has a beginner level on iq, if you know where to start it's a win for you, believe me, I've lost a lot. It looks really long on the code, because to do
this game it takes time if you don't know what you are working on like me, since I'm new at python. This game whas a little stressful because I had to look for information on how
big to do the lines of the x and the radius of the circle, had to do a lot of functions so it could work like it does. I created first the box function to then go to the others,
like the 0 entries function that in other words, it's where the 0 are made, had to put lot of mind there to know the exact point to go, had to play with it a lot to get it done.
NExt function was the x one that it was almost like the 0 function, but you get to see they are different, because obviously it's a letter not a number like the 0. They are almost
the same at how long it was written since they took time and they both have a specific color because you have to give them color so they can be different and know which one you are. 
The most difficult function was the def check(entries) because it took a long time to do so they could check the possibilities when you hit a box so they can enter the x or 0.
Finally we got the main function that tells us the window size, it tells the player to click a square so you can choose the square you wish to put your x or 0 and it tells you if 
you want to play again or no. This game isn't the best one that I wish to make since I made another one, a pong game but using a turtle module, since the proffesor wants a 
graphics.py I had to change it. Hope you like it!
